# Penetration Tester Interview Questions (Basic to Advanced)

## 1. Basic Questions

- **What are the primary phases of penetration testing?**
- **Explain the difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.**
- **How do you perform a basic network scan using Nmap?**
- **What is a vulnerability assessment, and how does it differ from penetration testing?**
- **Can you explain how SSL/TLS encryption works?**
- **What is the OWASP Top 10, and why is it important?**

## 2. Intermediate Questions

- **Describe how to exploit an SQL Injection vulnerability.**
- **What is the difference between black-box, white-box, and gray-box testing?**
- **How would you test for a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability?**
- **Explain the process of privilege escalation.**
- **What steps do you take after gaining access to a system during a penetration test?**
- **Can you explain how DNS tunneling works?**
- **How would you test a web application for vulnerabilities using Burp Suite?**
- **Describe the process of conducting wireless network penetration testing.**

## 3. Advanced Questions

- **How do you bypass antivirus and endpoint protection during a test?**
- **Can you explain what a buffer overflow is and how to exploit one?**
- **What are the steps for testing and exploiting an SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) vulnerability?**
- **How do you perform post-exploitation persistence on a compromised machine?**
- **Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption and how they are used in attacks.**
- **How would you exploit a vulnerable kernel to gain root privileges?**
- **Can you describe an advanced attack chain using multiple vulnerabilities in a penetration test?**
- **How do you prevent detection during a penetration test when interacting with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)?**

## 4. Behavioral Questions

- **Tell me about a time when you identified a critical vulnerability during a penetration test.**
- **How do you stay current with the latest trends in cybersecurity and penetration testing?**
- **Describe how you handle a situation where a client pushes back on the findings of your report.**
- **What is your approach to working with a team on a large-scale penetration test?**
- **Can you describe a time when you had to meet tight deadlines on a penetration test engagement?**

## 5. Scenario-Based Questions

- **You have been hired to test a web application. What is your step-by-step approach to testing it?**
- **Imagine you've gained access to an internal network but are unable to escalate privileges. What would be your next steps?**
- **You have limited time to conduct a penetration test. What key areas would you prioritize?**
- **How would you handle a situation where you accidentally cause downtime during a penetration test?**
- **During a test, you discover a vulnerability that could have a serious impact on the client. What do you do next?**
