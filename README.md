## Dedicated for Freshers, also asked with experianced condidates some questions.
  **Top 20 from list are strongly recommended.**

### 1. Information Security

> Information security is the process employed to safeguard information in any form (physical or electronic) from unauthorized access, disclosure, and destruction.

> According to NIST, it involves protecting information systems from unauthorized activities to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### 2. Cyber Security VS Information Security

### Cyber Security

> Cybersecurity focuses on safeguarding electronic data, preventing unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

> Its primary goal is to protect digital data and systems from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption.

### Information Security

> Information security is a broader discipline encompassing the protection of all types of assets, whether in hard copy or digital form.

> The main objective of information security is to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks and protect against unauthorized exploitation of systems, networks, and technologies.


### 3. What is CIA Triad ?

>CIA Triad an information security model meant to guide an organization’s security procedures and policies.

>Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These are the three core components of the CIA triad


- ```Confidentiality```
  
  >Confidentiality ensures  access to resources or data must be restricted to only authorized subjects or entities. Data encryption is a common method of ensuring confidentiality.
  
  
- ```Integrity```
  
  Integrity involves maintaining the consistency and accuracy of data over its entire life cycle. 
  
  Data must not be changed in transit, for example, when it is sent over the Internet or using a local area network
  
 

- ```availability```

  A vulnerability is a flaw, loophole, oversight, or error that can be exploited to violate the system security policy.
  
    For example, software or an application that has code vulnerable to a buffer or flow exploit.
  
### 4. Explain **Vulnerabilty**, **Threats**, **Exploit** and **Risk**.
- ```Vulnerabilty```
  
  >A vulnerability is a flaw, loophole, oversight, or error that can be exploited to violate system security policy. 
  
  >For example, a software or an application that has code vulnerable to a buffer or flow exploit.
  
  
- **```Threats```**
  
  >A threat is an event, natural or man-made, able to cause a negative impact on an organization.


- **```Exploit```**
  
  
  >An exploit is a defined way to breach the security of an IT system through a vulnerability.
  
  
- **```Risk```**
    ```
    It is an situation involving exposure to dange.
    ```
### 5. Define **Indentification**, **Authentication**, and **Authorization**?

### Identification

   > Identification is the process of recognizing and uniquely identifying a user within a system or application. It establishes who the user is.

### Authentication

   > Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of the user who has been identified. It ensures that the user is indeed who they claim to be.

### Authorization

   > Authorization is the process of determining the permissions and access levels granted to the authenticated user. It defines what resources and actions the user is allowed to access within the system.

  
   > What level of access someone have ,i.e process of granting access and defining the specific resources for a user's needs.
  

### 6. What is 3 way handshake?

>A three-way handshake is a method used in a TCP/IP network to create a connection between a local host/client and server.

- **```Step 1 (SYN):```**

    
    >In the first step, the client wants to establish a connection with a server, so it sends a segment with SYN(Synchronize Sequence Number) which informs the server that the client is likely to start communication and with what sequence number it starts segments with
    

- **```Step 2 (SYN + ACK):```**
    
    >The Server responds to the client request with SYN-ACK signal bits set. Acknowledgement(ACK) signifies the response of the segment it received and SYN signifies with what sequence number it is likely to start the segments with
    

- **```Step 3 (ACK):```**
    
    >In the final part client acknowledges the response of the server and they both establish a reliable connection with which they will start the actual data transfer
    
  
  
 ### 7. What is SSL/TLS handshake? 
 
 >In nutshell, SSL is obsolete and TLS is new name of older SSL protocol as modern encryption standard using by everybody. Technically, TLS is more accurate, but everyone knows SSL.
 

```SSL```    | ````TLS````
-------- | ------------
SSL stands for “Secure Socket Layer.” |	TLS stands for “Transport Layer Security.”
Netscape developed the first version of SSL in 1995. |	The first version of TLS was developed by the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF) in 1999.
SSL is a cryptographic protocol that uses explicit connections to establish secure communication between web server and client. | TLS is also a cryptographic protocol that  provides secure communication between web server and client via implicit connections. It’s the successor of SSL protocol.
Three versions of SSL have been released: SSL 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. |	Four versions of TLS have been released: TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.
All versions of SSL have been found vulnerable, and they all have been deprecated. |	TLS 1.0 and 1.1 have been “broken” and are deprecated as of March 2020. TLS 1.2 is the most widely deployed protocol version.

### 8. Accounting V/S Auditing.
- **```Accounting```**
    ```
    The Process of tracking and recording system activities and resource access.
    ```
-    **```Auditing```**
        ```
     The portion of accounting requires security professionals to examine logs of what was recorded.
        ```




### **9. Encription VS encoding Vs Hashing**

- **Black Box Penetration Testing**
    
    ```In black box penetration testing, tester has no idea about the systems that he is going to test. He is interested to gather information about the target network or system.```<br><br>

-  **White Box Penetration Testing**
    
    ```It is normally considered as a simulation of an attack by an internal source. It is also known as structural, glass box, clear box, and open box testing.``` <br><br>

    ```White box penetration testing examines the code coverage and does data flow testing, path testing, loop testing, etc```. <br><br>

- **Grey Box Penetration Testing**
   ```In this type of testing, a tester usually provides partial or limited information about the internal details of the program of a system.```
    

### 15. What is ports and  most common network ports and services.

| **Step**           | **Description**                                                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Initial Query**   | When searching for `www.example.com`, the browser and OS first check their local cache for the corresponding IP address. |
| **2. Cache Miss**      | If no record is found, the OS queries the "Resolving Name Server" (RNS) for the IP address. The RNS checks its own cache. |
| **3. Root Name Servers** | If the RNS does not have the record, it queries the Root Name Servers, which provide addresses of the TLD Name Servers for `.com`. |
| **4. TLD Name Servers** | The RNS queries the `.com` TLD Name Servers, which provide the address of the Authoritative Name Servers for `example.com`. |
| **5. Authoritative Name Servers** | The Authoritative Name Servers for `example.com` provide the IP address of `www.example.com`. The RNS caches this result and returns it to the OS. |

### **17. SSH Handshake Process**

| **Step**                 | **Description**                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Client Initiates**  | The SSH client initiates a connection to the SSH server by sending a connection request.       |
| **2. Server Responds**   | The SSH server responds with its public key and a set of supported encryption algorithms.       |
| **3. Key Exchange**      | The client and server exchange cryptographic keys to agree on a shared secret for encryption.    |
| **4. Authentication**    | The client sends an authentication request (username and password, or key-based authentication). |
| **5. Server Verifies**   | The server verifies the client's credentials. If valid, it sends an acknowledgment.             |
| **6. Secure Connection** | Once authentication is successful, both the client and server establish an encrypted session.   |

| **Step**                 | **Description**                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Client Initiates**  | The SSH client initiates a connection to the SSH server by sending a connection request.       |
| **2. Server Responds**   | The SSH server responds with its public key and a set of supported encryption algorithms.       |
| **3. Key Exchange**      | The client and server exchange cryptographic keys to agree on a shared secret for encryption.    |
| **4. Authentication**    | The client sends an authentication request (username and password, or key-based authentication). |
| **5. Server Verifies**   | The server verifies the client's credentials. If valid, it sends an acknowledgment.             |
| **6. Secure Connection** | Once authentication is successful, both the client and server establish an encrypted session.   |

    >Software system flaws or weaknesses in an application that could be exploited to compromise the security of the application.
    

- >`Buffer Overflow`
    
    >Buffer Overflows occur when there is more data in a buffer than it can handle, causing data to overflow into adjacent storage.
    

- >`Credentials Management`

    >A credentials management attack attempts to breach username/password pairs and take control of user accounts.
    


- >`CRLF Injection`

- >`Cross-Site Request Forgery`
    
    >Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a malicious attack that tricks the user’s web browser to perform undesired actions so that they appear as if an authorized user is performing those actions.
    

- >`Cross-Site Scripting`
    
    >XSS vulnerabilities target scripts embedded in a page that are executed on the client-side (in the user’s web browser) rather than on the server-side. 
    
- >`Directory Traversal`
    
    >Directory traversal is a type of HTTP exploit that is used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to restricted directories and files.
    

- >`Encapsulation`
    
    >Encapsulation refers to a programming approach that revolves around data and functions contained, or encapsulated, within a set of operating instructions.
    

- >`Error Handling`
    
    >Error Handling vulnerabilities occur when a system reveals detailed error messages or codes generated from stack traces, database dumps, and a wide variety of other problems, including out of memory, null pointer exceptions, and network timeout errors.
    
- >`Failure to Restrict URL Access`

    >One of the common vulnerabilities listed on the Open Web Application Security Project’s (OWASP) Top 10. The OWASP Top 10 details the most critical vulnerabilities in web applications. 
    

- >`Insecure Cryptographic Storage`
    
    >Insecure Cryptographic Storage is a common vulnerability that occurs when sensitive data is not stored securely from internal users. 
    

- >`Insufficient Transport Layer Protection`
    
    >Insufficient transport layer protection is a security weakness caused by applications not taking any measures to protect network traffic. 
    
- >`LDAP Injection`
    
    >LDAP injection is the technique of exploiting web applications that use client-supplied data in LDAP statements without first stripping potentially harmful characters from the request. 
    
- >`Malicious Code`
    
    >Analysis tools are designed to uncover any code in any part of a software system or script that is intended to cause undesired effects, security breaches or damage to a system.
    

- >`OS Command Injection`
    
    >Command injection refers to a class of critical application vulnerabilities involving dynamically generated content. Attackers execute arbitrary commands on a host operating system using a vulnerable application.
    

- >`Race Condition`
    
    >A race condition attack happens when a computing system that’s designed to handle tasks in a specific sequence is forced to perform two or more operations simultaneously.
    
- >`SQL Injection`
    
    >SQL injection is a type of web application security vulnerability in which an attacker is able to submit a database SQL command, which is executed by a web application, exposing the back-end database.
    
- >`Null Byte Injection`
    
    >The null character is a control character with the value zero. 

    >It is also possible to pass the null character in the URL, which creates a vulnerability known as Null Byte Injection and can lead to security exploits.
    
    >In the URL it is represented by %00.
     
    
    >Ex- Image with the name hello.gif and can be changed to hello.phpA.gif. Try replacing the hex value of A (\x60) with null byte which is (\x00)
    

- >`Port Knocking :`

    >In computer networking, port knocking is a method of externally opening ports on a firewall by generating a connection attempt on a set of prespecified closed ports.
    
- >`Command Injection`

	>Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating 

    >system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell.
    
- >'`ShellShock Vulnerability`
    
	>Shellshock is a security bug causing Bash to execute commands from environment variables unintentionally.

	>Since the environment variables are not sanitized properly by Bash before being executed, the attacker
	>can send commands to the server through HTTP requests and get them executed by the web server operating system. 

	>An attacker can potentially use CGI to send a malformed environment variable to a vulnerable Web server. Because the server uses Bash to interpret the variable, it will also run any malicious command tacked-on to it.
